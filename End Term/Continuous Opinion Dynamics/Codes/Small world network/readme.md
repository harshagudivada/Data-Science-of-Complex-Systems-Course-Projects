## Simulate.py saves a numpy array [steady_state.py] which contains the steady state opinons of agents for a range of epsilon values. It does so for the small world network. 

# Instructions to use the code
- Open your terminal and run "python3 simulate.py"
- It'll take about 500 seconds for the code to run
- Then run "python3 plot.py" to generate the plots

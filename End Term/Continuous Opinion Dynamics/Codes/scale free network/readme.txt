The main code is called main.m

It calls function SF_ntwrk to create a scale free network

It calls function opiniondynamics to get steady state opinions of agents on that network

For different initial opinion distribution, there are different codes:

1. for uniform random distribution function is opiniondynamics
2. for bimodal random distribution function is opiniondynamics2
3. for Gaussian random distribution function is opiniondynamics3
